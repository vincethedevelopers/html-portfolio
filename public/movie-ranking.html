<h1>The Best Movies According to Vince</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>James Bond</h3>
<p>Watching No Time To Die, I left this world for the duration of the film. I was transported, captivated, charmed, engaged in the characters (especially Daniel Craig's Bond swansong) and emotionally connected with Bond's love affair and the emergence of a gorgeous and endearing Bond legacy.
    Much was made of the longest running time of any Bond film, but I was so engrossed that I didn't notice the length.</p>

<h3>The wolf of wall street</h3>
<p>The Wolf of Wall Street is one of my favorite films of all time for many reasons. After seeing it for the first time when I was 13, I was very intrigued with becoming like Jordan Belfort. Now that I am mature enough to know better, and after countless rewatches, I realize that this movie is a critic of this kind of lifestyle. Sure, the drug-fueled, insane, mayhem that Belfort goes through makes for an entertaining movie with an amazing soundtrack. However, I feel that Martin Scorsese intended this to be a display of the way power and money can corrupt someone when he becomes the king of the world and has enough money to spend on several lifetimes.</p>

<h3>Crazy asian rich </h3>
<p>To start the movie is amazing, highlighting countless up and coming Asian comedians, amazing fashion, and amazing music. It's super close to the book (although it cut out a lot of it to keep it short) and I can't wait to see the other books put into live action. In fact, seeing it on screen surpassed what I could've imagined the dresses and people to look like. </p>
